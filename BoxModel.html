                GitHub is a cloud-based platform that leverages Git, an open-source version control system, to help developers 
                manage and track changes in their code. It facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple people to work on a 
                project simultaneously, track revisions, and contribute from anywhere in the world. GitHub offers a range of 
                features including repositories for storing code, pull requests for code review, and GitHub Actions for automating 
                workflows. It supports both individual developers and large organizations with free and paid plans12. Acquired by 
                Microsoft in 2018, GitHub has become an essential tool for modern software development
